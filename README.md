# The Advent of Code 2019

This is my journey through the Advent of Code 2019. The premise is just a normal advent calendar, but every day is a new programming challenge

## Disclaimer

This code is not meant to be in any way efficient or readable, it's just quick solutions to simple problems. I can't promise anything about how much you can learn from my own solutions, but I will attempt to do a simple writeup on the challenge within each day folder
